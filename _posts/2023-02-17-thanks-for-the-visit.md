I am so glad you are here. My name is Patrick Cuba and I have worked for SLU
since 2002.

As a member of the Reserach Computing Group, I design and implement tools, 
  services, and software for use by researchers, students, and the public.
  With a focus on scholarly research needs, I have decades of experience in 
  cultural heritage and digital humanities solutions with expertise in web 
  applications, ambiguous data encoding, and human-driven annotation.

I have several projects that relate to research at SLU:

* [RERUM Service](https://centerfordigitalhumanities.github.io/blog/rerum-alpha/)
* [TPEN Transcription](https://centerfordigitalhumanities.github.io/blog/t-pen-development-advance-post/)

I contribute to several open source projects and maintain the organization 
housing RCG projects ([GitHub](https://github.com/CenterForDigitalHumanities)).
